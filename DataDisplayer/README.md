# DataDisplay
This program works like a data diplay, it is currently works with data form JSON and XML file, in order to add new source of data we need to create a class which inherits Builder interface which is consist of Construct and BuildOutput methods. Construct need a path of file and after get it creates list of strings. BuildOutput return us a final product which is sending to our View, so View "dont care" about the source of this data.
